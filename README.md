#####updated by Atul-Nambudiri

This directory contains the file syncing code

####implemented features:
* Sync a whole directory
* Copy a directory when a new client comes up

###HowTo:
* There are two python scripts, server.py and client.py. Server.py represents an existing client with fully synced files, while client.py is a newly spun up client.
* Put any files that you would like to sync in the in/ folder. You can have subfolders
* Run server.py
* In a seperate terminal, run client.py
* The client will request all the files in servers synced folder. It will save the files into the out/ directory


testing
------------------------------------------
